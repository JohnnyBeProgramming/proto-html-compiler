{"name":"HTML Compiler and Translator (Javascript)","tagline":"Prototyped HTML DOM Parser and compiler","body":"# HTML Compiler and Translator (Javascript)\r\n\r\nThis package can compile and parse the HTML DOM into a JSON object for more efficient storage and retrieval. \r\n\r\nGiven a valid JSON payload, the compiler can then translate this into the resulting HTML DOM into the current page.\r\n\r\nThe compiler can also generate files to a designated folder where you can inspect and copy the data models. \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can install the library from npm:\r\n\r\n    npm install proto-html-compiler --save-dev\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nIn NodeJS, you can get the package and configure the options:\r\n\r\n    // Get the package\r\n    var fs = require('fs');\r\n    var compiler = require('proto-html-compiler');\r\n\r\n    // Initialise compiler options\r\n    compiler.init({\r\n        debug: false,\r\n        base: '../app',\r\n        dest: './compiled/',\r\n        clearHtml: false,\r\n        mergeGroups: false,\r\n        queueActions: true,\r\n        minifyScripts: true,\r\n        scriptElements: true,\r\n        ignoreComments: true,\r\n        trimWhiteSpace: true,\r\n        /*\r\n        templHtml: './templates/Compiled.html',\r\n        templPathJS: './templates/Injector.js',\r\n        */\r\n    }, fs);\r\n    \r\n    // Compile the html text into a JSON object\r\n    compiler.gen(filename, htmlContents)\r\n            .then(function(output) {\r\n              console.log('Compiled Output:', output);\r\n            })\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis library was written because I needed a way to represent a HTML document as a JSON data model that can be modified and re-applied or replaced if need be.  \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nNo tests have been set up for this project.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThis library is provided \"as-is\" and totally free to use. No support comes with it. If you want to make a contribution or include a new feature, you can create a pull request. I will reserve the right to update this package as new requirements become available.   \r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 JohnnyBeProgramming - http://www.prototyped.info\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
